# Masterthesis "Megamap" - Code Repository

This is the code repository that contains my Megamap implementation used for the small-scale user study in my master thesis. You can find the thesis itself [here](https://github.com/Mowalle/master-thesis "GitHub Repository for Megamap Thesis").

A video demo of the latest version is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1xSv9Zr9JI "Megamap on YouTube").

## About

This project is realized in the Unity Engine, using C# for the various scripts. It is an implementation used for a small-scale user study to determine usable parameters for the Megamap concept. This is just a prototype application and does not reflect the entire Megamap concept, which is described in more detail in the thesis linked above.
